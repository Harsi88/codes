Lab 6:

Consider a hospital that is being audited. Write a program that uses structures to store a patient record. Thereafter, based on a user input, allow the program to return the MEAN/MEDIAN/MODE of a particular patient attribute. 

Let's say (and you may use this as your starting template):

typedef struct{

	char name[30];
	char gender[2];
	int age,ht,wt;
} patient;


this means that each patient is represented by his/her name, gender, age (yrs),height (cms), weight (kilos). Now the user should at run time be allowed to enter "n" number of patients (you may chose "n" accordingly - but greater than 10) and then allow to make queries such as the following:

>>Enter (1) for Median (2) Mode (3) Mean -->
>>For (1) MALE (2) Female (3) ALL -->
>>Of (1)Age (2)weight (3)Height -->

So if the user enters:

>>Enter (1) for Median (2) Mode (3) Mean -->3
>>For (1) MALE (2) Female (3) ALL -->1
>>Of (1)Age (2)weight (3)Height -->2

the output should be:

The MEAN Weight of all MALE patients = ___ years.

Similarly for other input combinations.


Needless to mention: You may want to look up formal definitions of MEAN, MEDIAN and MODE.
